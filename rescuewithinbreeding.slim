// interesting scenarios for distribution of deleterious fitness effects: (A) normal(-0.05,0.01) has lots of deleterious variation before selection and either extinction or lowered carrying capacity after. quantitative loci mostly don't get fixed, deleterious mutations become fairly common! (B) normal(-0.3,0.06) or (-0.2,0.04) and higher average fitness effects has little deleterious variation before selection and evolutionary rescue almost always brings population back to original carrying capacity. quantitative loci get fixed without increase in frequency of deleterious recessive mutations. (C) normal (0,0), i.e. no deleterious recessive variation, also interesting (evolutionary rescue usually happens!). (D) normal(-0.005, 0.001) has lots of very weak deleterious variation which gets fixed along with quantitative variation. usually evolutionary rescue but sometime not (and somewhat lower carrying capacity after selection)!
